          My name is Ryan Carey and I originally went to school for accounting.
          After deciding that I wanted more out of my work life I switched gears
          and took a coding bootcamp through the University of New Hampshire. My
          love of computers traces back to when I was a child and I would always
          be going through all the settings on the family computer and wowing my
          family with the things I was doing. I hope to acquire a job and be
          able to turn my passion into a career.
